## Background
This is fundamentally a **study guide** from my personal notes initially created to deepen my understanding of Lisp and programming in general.

`The Little Schemer' (4th edition) by Daniel Friedman and Matthias Felleisen is a remarkable book
that teaches programming concepts in a unique and playful way. 

## Contents
